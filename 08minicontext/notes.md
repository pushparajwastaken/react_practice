`Context API`
The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share state (data) across multiple components without having to pass props manually at every level (also known as "prop drilling"). Itâ€™s a built-in solution for managing global state in your React application.

## Normally, in React, you pass data from a parent component to child components using props. But when multiple components need the same data, passing props through every level can become difficult. Context API helps solve this by providing a global state that any component can access.
